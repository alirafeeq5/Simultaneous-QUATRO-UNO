# Simultaneous-QUATRO-UNO
There are two players, and each one gets 4 cards, a "4", a "3", a "2", a "1". Each player orders his or her four cards into a pile. Then repeatedly both players reveal their leftmost card. The lower card is taken away from the pile, thrown away, and the higher one, the winning one, remains in the pile.
